The classic alien menace and scourge of humanity we all know and hate has finally arrived, rejoice!
(There WILL be updates so stay subbed dudes)

New:
_____________________
Made Zeta's draw size/portrait tinier to match their nerd physic

Balance + Tweaks:
_____________________
Removed the shortterm negative effects to breathing, hearing, and sight from zeta's stare attack 
Stare power (Damage) lowered from 12 > 8
Stare power severity stages (serious,extreme,etc) now easier to reach
Severity of sub-atomic breakdown applied per stare damge raised 0.012 > 0.018

Retinal Scrambler range raised 30.9 > 36.9, on par with the base rifle
Muzzle Flash lowered from 14 > 10

Chance of random wanderer joining being zeta raised rather than human, maybe, i'm not sure if it already rounded up to 100% tbh. I think it's the same.

Removed race bonuses to psychic entropy, i'll check out what i can do with the new system in a future patch.
